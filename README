This is the C2-Ray code for time-dependent photo-ionization calculations.
This version is for 3D, multiple sources, and for hydrogen only.
It runs under both MPI and OpenMP.

The factorization branch is a new version which tries to reduce the
length of subroutines to make the code more manageable and easier
to read. It is still under construction so this set of routines
will not compile yet.
